This is an app for use by the staff of Gary Comer College Prep in Chicago. The features requested by the client were:

- Teachers are able to put together rosters of students from a list of all available students.
- The list of students would also include some basic stats (like GPA, detentions earned, etc.).
- Teachers could see some team averages for each stat as they did that, and other teachers could see each other's teams
- Teachers can't move kids off of other teams. Only the admin can control everything.
- Ideally, I'd be able to upload player names and stats from a simple CSV file.
- Ideally, student stats would be customizable based on the headers in the spreadsheet.
- I'd like a place where I could insert rules to follow for team picking, even if those weren't hard-coded into the app.
